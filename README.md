# [Project 1: Precipitation analysis using R](https://github.com/NicholasNunez/precipitation-analysis-R)
- Joined data sets pulled from daymet for comparing three watersheds.
- Grouped by summarized data by week of the year and month of the year.
- Plotted data by month of year with error bars.
- This analysis proved that seasonality was not influencing the chemical analysis data.

# [Project 2: Chemical analysis in Puerto Rico Watersheds using R](https://github.com/NicholasNunez/chem-analysis-puertorico-watersheds)
- Selected specific solutes from .csv file.
- Filtered by site and solute.
- Binned data by region.
- Calculated coefficient of variation.
- Plotted solutes by data and plotted coefficient of variation by week of year. 
- This analysis proved that there was an increase in the solute of interest during the time period of interest and that coefficient of variation could function as a proxy for increase in solute.

# Project 3: COVID trend analysis using Power BI
- Pulled Covid-19 data from kaggle.
- Filtered out China to see most affected countries after the initial outbreak.
- Calculated days between first symptoms and hospitilzation to show if this affected recovery and mortality rate.
- This analysis showed an increase in mortality rate on the seventh day between symptoms and hospitilization.

# Project 4: Chronic illnesses and amount reimbursed and deductible paid for patients in France using Power BI
- Pulled data from kaggle.
- Showed distribution of chronic illnesses.
- Added map to demonstrate amount paid and which chronic illness is present by region.
- Plotted amount in deductible and amount reimbursed to patients by their date of birth.
- This analysis demonstrated that patients born between 1920-1940 were the most active in using their healthcare and that the vast amount of beneficiaries are in the region directly south of Paris.

# Project 5: Healthcare provider costs over time using Power BI
- Pulled data from kaggle.
- Demonstrated trend of increasing costs over time per expense.
- Added map to demonstrate costs of each expense by country.
- This analysis showed a trend of increasing costs for the company over time but that recent efforts to reduce expenses are working at a global scale. However, to continue the trend there could be some adjusting on a country to country basis.

# Project 6: Healthcare job satisfaction by department using Tableau
- Pulled data from kaggle.
- Color coded by department.
- Calculated average years worked in comparison to job satisfaction.
- The neurology department showed the highest amount of job satisfaction despite its low employee count. Also we can clearly see the highest amount of job satisfaction and time worked at the company was attributed to roles in the administrative level.
