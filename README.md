# [Project 1: Precipitation analysis using R](https://github.com/NicholasNunez/precipitation-analysis-R)
- Joined data sets pulled from daymet for comparing three watersheds.
- Grouped by summarized data by week of the year and month of the year.
- Plotted data by month of year with error bars.
- This analysis proved that seasonality was not influencing the chemical analysis data.

# [Project 2: Chemical analysis in Puerto Rico Watersheds using R](https://github.com/NicholasNunez/chem-analysis-puertorico-watersheds)
- Selected specific solutes from .csv file.
- Filtered by site and solute.
- Binned data by region.
- Calculated coefficient of variation.
- Plotted solutes by data and plotted coefficient of variation by week of year. 
- This analysis proved that there was an increase in the solute of interest during the time period of interest and that coefficient of variation could function as a proxy for increase in solute

# Project 3: COVID trend analysis using Power BI
- Pulled Covid-19 data from kaggle.
- Filtered out China to see most affected countries after the initial outbreak.
- Calculated days between first symptoms and hospitilzation to show if this affected recovery and mortality rate.
- This analysis showed an increase in mortality rate on the seventh day between symptoms and hospitilization.
